# Hello Git and GitHub

This is a practice repository while I'm learning to code and use Git (and GitHub).

## The Codecademy's Learn C# Course:
* I have started learning some basics of _C#_ as my first programming language on Feb 12, 2023
* I also learned the basics on how to use _Git_ and _GitHub_
* So while I was doing that I sort off picked up some knowledge of _Markdown_
* As a part of a portfolio project on Codecademy I was tasked to show my understanding of _Git_ by contributing to the Codecademy Docs through their official repository
* Finished and pulled the Exquisite Corpse task into the practice repository - Feb 20, 2023
* Finished and pulled the Caesar's Cipher task into the practice repository - Feb 21, 2023
* Finished and pulled the True and False task into the practice repository - Feb 22, 2023
* Finished and pulled the The Object of Your Affection task into the practice repository - Feb 25, 2023
* My pull request at the Codecademy repository was successfully merged into the main branch. You can check out my contribution [here](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/c-sharp/math-functions/pow) - Feb 27, 2023
* Finished and pulled the App Interfaces task into the practice repository - Feb 28, 2023
* Finished and pulled the Supernatural Inheritance task into the practice repository - Mar 02, 2023
* Finished and pulled the Rover Control Center task into the practice repository - Mar 04, 2023
* Finished the Learn C# Course on Codecademy and got a certificate of completition. Hurrah! - Mar 04, 2023

## Learning Series : Beginner Level
* I have started a new series for myself today. I will be coding begginer level apps in order to raise my skill with C#. Wish me luck :smile: - Mar 06, 2023

Anyway, I'll keep you guys posted on how I progress through my learning journey.

***Cheers!***
