# Hello Git and GitHub

This is a practice repository while I'm learning to code and use Git (and GitHub).

>So far I have started learning some basics of **C#**<br>
>And basics on how to use **Git** and **GitHub**<br>
>Yes, I've also tried some **Markdown** editing.<br>

Anyway, I'll keep you guys posted on how I progress through my learning journey.

***Cheers!***
