# Hello Git and GitHub

This is a practice repository while I'm learning to code and use Git (and GitHub).

## The Codecademy's Learn C# Course:
* I have started learning some basics of _C#_ as my first programming language on Feb 12, 2023
* I also learned the basics on how to use _Git_ and _GitHub_
* So while I was doing that I sort off picked up some knowledge of _Markdown_
* As a part of a portfolio project on Codecademy I was tasked to show my understanding of _Git_ by contributing to the Codecademy Docs through their official repository
* Finished and pulled the Exquisite Corpse task into the practice repository - Feb 20, 2023
* Finished and pulled the Caesar's Cipher task into the practice repository - Feb 21, 2023
* Finished and pulled the True and False task into the practice repository - Feb 22, 2023
* Finished and pulled the The Object of Your Affection task into the practice repository - Feb 25, 2023
* My pull request at the Codecademy repository was successfully merged into the main branch. You can check out my contribution [here](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/docs/c-sharp/math-functions/pow) - Feb 27, 2023
* Finished and pulled the App Interfaces task into the practice repository - Feb 28, 2023
* Finished and pulled the Supernatural Inheritance task into the practice repository - Mar 02, 2023
* Finished and pulled the Rover Control Center task into the practice repository - Mar 04, 2023
* Finished the Learn C# Course on Codecademy and got a certificate of completition. Hurrah! - Mar 04, 2023

## Learning Series : Beginner Level
* I have started a new series for myself today. I will be coding begginer level apps in order to raise my skill with C#. Wish me luck :smile: - Mar 06, 2023
* So I took a little time off from coding because there were some things in life that I had to take care of. But no worries because I am back now :smile: - Apr, 2023/Oct, 2023
* Finished my first beginner level app. I named it Noteman - The Note Taking App. As the name says this app is ment for taking simple notes and linking external files with those notes. The UI is build through Windows Forms and storage gets handled through SQLite local database. It took me a lot of time to finish this thing but I have to say that I learned a lot about many things that are needed to get an even simple app as this to work. It was my first for many things, first Windows Forms, first SQLite database, first time to link a database to C# programming etc. I'm really glad it came together as good as it did. Now on to the next app. What should I do next :thinking: - Oct 06, 2023

Anyway, I'll keep you guys posted on how I progress through my learning journey.

***Cheers!***
