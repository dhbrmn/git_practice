# Hello Git and GitHub

This is a practice repository while I'm learning to code and use Git (and GitHub).

* I have started learning some basics of _C#_ as my first programming language on Feb 12, 2023
* I also learned the basics on how to use _Git_ and _GitHub_
* So while I was doing that I sort off picked up some knowledge of _Markdown_
* As a part of a portfolio project on Codecademy I was tasked to show my understanding of _Git_ by contributing to the Codecademy Docs through their official repository
* Finnished and pulled the Exquisite Corpse task into the practice repository - Feb 20, 2023
* Finished and pulled the Caesar's Cipher task into the practice repository - Feb 21, 2023
* Finished and pulled the True and False task into the practice repository - Feb 22, 2023
* Finished and pulled the The Object of Your Affection task into practice repository - Feb 25, 2023

Anyway, I'll keep you guys posted on how I progress through my learning journey.

***Cheers!***
